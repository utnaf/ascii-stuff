## ASCIImage

This is an exercise I made to learn some Python. It's actually my first Py code ever, so bear with me ;)

## Wat

It takes an image and prints on terminal it's ASCII color art representation.

## How

Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run the script with `-t` to print the result on the terminal
```
python asciimage.py -l test.jpg
```

### Various
Feel free to contribute, comment, suggest, cry, smile, or whatever you do when you see something awesome :)

Still work in progress, I have some ideas for this that I will implement when I have some time. Thanks for stopping by anyway!
