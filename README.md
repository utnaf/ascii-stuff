## ASCII Stuff

This is an exercise I made to lear some Python. 

## Wat

It takes an image and prints on terminal it's ASCII art representation.

## How

You need [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) to run this script, so please make sure to have it installed and then run

```
python ascii.py test.jpg
```

Should return somethin like

### Various
Feel free to contribute, comment, suggest, cry, smile, or whatever you do when you see something awesome :)

Still work in progress, I have some ideas for this that I will implement when I have some time. Thanks for stopping by anyway!
