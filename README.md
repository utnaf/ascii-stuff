## ASCIImage

This is an exercise I made to learn some Python. It's actually my first Py code ever, so bear with me ;)

## Wat

It takes an image and prints on terminal it's ASCII color art representation.

## How

Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the script
```bash
python asciimage.py -l test.jpg
```

or use the `-u` option to get the image from the web
```bash
python asciimage.py -u https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1318539?s=460&v=4
```

Your browser should open and show someting like this:

### Various
Feel free to contribute, comment, suggest, cry, smile, or whatever you do when you see something awesome :)

Still work in progress, I have some ideas for this that I will implement when I have some time. Thanks for stopping by anyway!
