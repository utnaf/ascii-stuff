        ## ASCIImage
        
        This is an exercise I made to learn some Python. It's actually my first Py code ever, so bear with me ;)
        
        ## Wat
        
        It takes an image and prints on terminal it's ASCII color art representation.
        
        ## How
        
        Install requirements
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        And run the script with `-t` to print the result on the terminal
        ```
        python asciimage.py -l test.jpg
        ```
        
        ### Various
        Feel free to contribute, comment, suggest, cry, smile, or whatever you do when you see something awesome :)
        
        Still work in progress, I have some ideas for this that I will implement when I have some time. Thanks for stopping by anyway!
