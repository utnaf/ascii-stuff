        ## ASCIImage
        
        This is an exercise I made to learn some Python. It's actually my first Py code ever, so bear with me ;)
        
        ## Wat
        
        It takes an image and prints on terminal it's ASCII color art representation.
        
        ## How
        
        Install requirements
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        Run the script
        ```bash
        python asciimage.py -l test.jpg
        ```
        
        or use the `-u` option to get the image from the web
        ```bash
        python asciimage.py -u https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1318539?s=460&v=4
        ```

        Still work in progress, I have some ideas for this that I will implement when I have some time. Thanks for stopping by anyway!
