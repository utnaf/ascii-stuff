Description: ## ASCIImage
        
        This is an exercise I made to learn some Python. It's actually my first Py code ever, so bear with me ;)
        
        ## Wat
        
        It takes an image and prints on terminal it's ASCII color art representation.
        
        ## How
        
        You need [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) to run this script, so please make sure to have it installed and then run
        
        ```
        python asciimage.py -f test.jpg
        ```
        
        Where test.jpg is this one
        
        ![c&h](https://github.com/utnaf/ascii-stuff/raw/master/test.jpg)
        
        Should return somethin like
        
        ![result in terminal](https://github.com/utnaf/ascii-stuff/raw/master/result.png)
        
        ## Other options
        
        ### Use an url as input
        
        ```
        python asciimage.py -u https://bit.ly/2Iys8VP
        ```
        
        ### Output in grayscale
        
        ```
        python asciimage.py -f test.jpg -g
        ```
        
        ### Save it to an HTML file
        
        ```
        python asciimage.py -f test.jpg -s
        ```
        
        ### Various
        Feel free to contribute, comment, suggest, cry, smile, or whatever you do when you see something awesome :)
        
        Still work in progress, I have some ideas for this that I will implement when I have some time. Thanks for stopping by anyway!
